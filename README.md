Submitted by: **Thierry Laguerre**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**GO PETS** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs. With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes! This app showcases a fun and interactive welcome screen for pet lovers, encouraging users to engage with cute visuals and clean design.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üê∂ üì± ‚ú®

## Notes

This project helped reinforce my understanding of layout nesting, ConstraintLayout usage, and drawable management in Android. Fixing some Kotlin bugs also improved my confidence in reading and debugging Android-specific code.
